<h1>The History of Dance</h1> 
<h2>Hello! This website takes a look into the journey that dance has taken throughout time.</h2>

<p>Hi my name is Connie Power and like this title suggests, this page is all about The History of Dance! This project will explore dance throughout history and the development that it has taken through the years. How dance has evolved across time from ballroom dancing or tribal dances which are traced way back to ancient civilizations and primitive cave paintings. Throughout this project, I am going to look into dance throughout the ages, its cultural history, dance in paintings, in costumes, and its many genres. :) </p> 

<h2> What Is Dance? </h2> 

<p> Like this title suggests, what is dance? 
Dance has many explanations of what it is. Dance could be when we move rhythmically to music along with a series of steps but also a way that we can express ourselves through movement, music or no music. A way of communication without the need to use words. Dance can be seen as an art form, a sport and can signify many things and tell many stories.
  Throughout dance there are known to be five universal elements, five key attributes which are involved in any form of dance:  
</p> 

<h3> The Body </h3>

<p>The body is like an instrument, which allows us to express ourselves. Professional dancers have trained their bodies in order to have exceptional agility and strength but also to be free and move easily.</p>

<h3>Action</h3>

<p> An action is the way something is done and in this case how the dancers move either by leaping across the floor or even just spinning in the spot. There are endless ways a dancer can express themselves by action.</p>

<h3> Space</h3>

<p> When you dance you move through space in relation to your own dance or as a group, weaving and moving through space in every possible way from ballet to jazz. </p>

<h3> Time </h3>

<p> Time, when dancing is used for rhythm and beat. When you choreograph dance you need to be able to move to the beat even if you are doing ballet, break dance or soul dancing. </p>

<h3> Energy </h3>

<p>The dynamics in dance is strongly related to energy. Energy is what speaks to the dancer as they move, going through space and time and passion. </p>
